# THE DNA
From any stranger

# About
This is the raw genetic data from [23andMe](http://23andme.com/).

Fields are tab-separated. Each line corresponds to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). For each SNP, the following are provided:
* an identifier (an rsid or an internal id)
* its location on the reference human genome
* the genotype call oriented with respect to the plus strand on the human reference sequence.

This data uses reference human assembly build 37 (also known as Annotation Release 104). See 

# Viewing
The data is in [genome.txt](https://github.com/marencc/Challenge_1/master/genome.txt).
